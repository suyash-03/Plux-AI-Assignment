        "This assignment involves building an end-to-end question answering (Q&A) system that operates on a provided dataset containing information about investment funds and their investments. Your goal is to develop a pipeline that accurately answers user queries based on the data from two CSV files: filer.csv and investment.csv. You will implement this project in  notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset description\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains two CSV files:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### filer.csv: Contains information about investment funds.\n",
        "    name: Name of the fund.\n",
        "    cik: Unique identifier for each fund.\n",
        "    series: Series of the fund.\n",
        "    series_id: Unique identifier for each series.\n",

        "    value_usd: Value of the investment in USD.\n",
        "    percentage_investment: Percentage of the fund's total assets invested in this particular investment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Assignment Breakdown:\n",
        "The assignment is divided into four sections with increasing complexity:\n",
        "1. Test Setup (10 points)\n",
        "2. Basic data analysis (15 points)\n",
        "3. Basic QnA (25 points)\n",
        "4. Complex QnA (50 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Notes\n",
        "- If full implementation is challenging, you may provide a detailed textual description of your proposed approach and logic.\n",
        "- You are encouraged to utilize LLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro to enhance your QnA system for this section.\n",
        "- While handling a variety of questions is valuable, your primary focus should be on the accuracy of the answers provided by your Q&A system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Assignment Feedback\n",
        "\n",
        "P.S. Here is an anonymous [feedback link](https://forms.gle/2aLVTQU28zV2fHnF6) for the assignment. It'd be great if you can provide your feedback about the assignment as we are continuously looking to improve our recruiting process.\n"
